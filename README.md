# Computer-Vision-Projects

This repository contains 3 small computer vision projects done during my master in Artificial Intelligence at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven:

- Objects tracking and images transformation by using the Python OpenCV library (see demo #[video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eof01ACtSsluQcdi3uJnwTjfwWy5Yabq/view?usp=drive_link) generated).
- Celebrity face detection. Developed preprocessing functions, data augmentation, different CNN architectures and used transfer learning to improve classification accuracy.
- Coded multi-label classification algorithms using image segmentation, one hot encoding. We took part in a Kaggle competition.
